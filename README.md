# Tech Demo: Svelte app
By Rafael Buck - rbuc039

## Running my tech demo app

To run the app:
- Clone or download this repository to a folder on your machine. 
- Open the newly created folder in VSCode. 
- Open a terminal and run

 ```bash
npm install
```
- You will then be able to compile and run the app with hot reload functionality using

```bash
npm run dev
``` 

## Compare to Lab 2 solution
In this project I have recreated the pokemon cart from lab 2 exercise 6. If you want to compare how Svelte is used to React, you can look at the lab 2 solution provided in the lab 2 module on canvas.

The lab solution will not have the remove from cart button, the products on special, or the default error page.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
